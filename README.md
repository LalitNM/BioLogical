# BioLogical

This is a model of a digital Hearing Aid. We started with an audio file and processed it in MATLAB and Simulink. We reduced the noise and improved overall quality of the audio signal so that a person with hearing loss can hear it properly. The team BioLogical consists of Aditya Narayan, Laishram Pongthang and Lalit Narayan. This is a final project in the course on "Biosensing and Bioinstrumentation". This course was taught by Dr. Srikanth Sugavanam at IIT Mandi during odd semester 2021.
