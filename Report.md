### Introduction

Hearing is one of the most precious senses humans can have. Hearing helps one to sense the environment and plays a major role in communication  with others. Human beings are able to hear sound ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz but most sensitive to 1kHz to 4kHz. Sound pressure level are used to measure the loudness of sound for human ears (210-5Pa is the minimum threshold for human hearing) and is defined in decibel (dB), which ranges from 0 dB to 120 dB. Unfortunately, a person used to lose hearing abilities because of accidents, hereditary and ageing. There are two types of hearing loss, conductive loss and sensorineural loss. One can suffer from either one or both. In the conduction loss the middle ear is damaged which prevents the conduction of the sound energy from the outer ear to the middle ear. In sensorineural loss,  some auditory nerves are no longer able to send electrical pulse to the brain and this is caused by natural ageing of an individual. The  sensorineural loss is characterised by following:

- Sinking of dynamic range between the soft and sound speech
- Loss of certain frequency components (mostly high frequencies)
- Hinders the ability to detect sound of different frequencies occurring one after the other.

Sensorineural loss of hearing can be mitigated by using hearing aids. Miller Reese Hutchison made the first ever electric hearing aid in the year 1893. First commercial hearing aids were launched in 1913. The Basic function of hearing aids is to control loudness, frequency and background noise to aid  the patients hear speech or desired sounds without discomfort.
